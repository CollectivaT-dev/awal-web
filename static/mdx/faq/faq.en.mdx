## I'm not confident in my writing skills in Catalan/Spanish/French/Arabic. What should I do?

No need to worry! If you have a good understanding of the language, you can still make valuable contributions. Utilize the "Random Sentence" button to load a source sentence automatically, and then provide its translation into Tamazight. Additionally, you're welcome to extract sentences from non-copyrighted sources, such as Wikipedia, to diversify the type of translations we collect.

## I fixed a mistake in the machine translation output, but it still makes the same error. Is my contribution not being saved?


Your contributions are saved in our database, but they won't immediately affect the machine translation. The improvement will happen in a later phase, after we collect enough quality translations from contributors like you. So, your efforts are valuable and will contribute to enhancing the translation engine over time.

## How are contribution scores for translations calculated?

Your contribution points are determined by the character length of both the source sentence you input and its translation. If you manually input the source and translate from scratch (i.e., without using 'Pre-translate'), your points will be the total characters in both sentences. If you use the machine translation engine by clicking 'Pre-translate,' your points for the translation will be based on the number of character edits you make to the machine-translated output. If you load a source phrase from the database using 'Random sentence,' you'll only earn points for your translation, not the source sentence.

## Do I gain points from voice contributions in Common Voice?

Unfortunately, for now, the points system is only based on translation contributions. In the future, we would like to also include voice contributions in the contribution points.

## I forgot my password and cannot access my account. What should I do?

We are still working on password recovery. In the meanwhile, you can open another account and contact us at awal@collectivat.cat so that we transfer your points to your new account.

## I already have an account in AWAL. Do I need to create one also in Common Voice?

Even though it's not obligatory, we recommend creating an account in Common Voice. This way, you can see how much you have contributed and fill in your details in your profile.
