title: 'Contribution Terms'

Awal is a non-profit initiative that contributes to the digitization of the Amazigh language through the collection of open-source datasets and the development of innovative tools.  
Awal's web portal permits the free contribution of translated phrases for the objective of developing machine translation applications.
You can only make contributions and validate translated phrases by signing up for the initiative. By signing up, you must agree to abide by these terms.  
Awal also partners with Mozilla's Common Voice initiative for the collection of open-source speech datasets, enabling anyone to build voice-based applications for Tamazight. Please note that contributions to Common Voice are subject to [Mozilla's legal terms.](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/terms).  
In these terms, 'we,' 'our,' or 'us' refer to the collaborators and administrators of Awal, the non-profit initiative. 'You' or 'your' pertains to the user, contributor, or volunteer engaging with and contributing to the Awal platform.  
## Translation Contributions

A translation contribution consists of a sentence in either Catalan, Spanish, English, Arabic, or French with its translation in Tamazight. You can translate from Tamazight to one of the other languages or vice versa. Contributions are accepted in both Tifinagh and the Latin alphabet.  
The contributions are stored initially in Col·lectivaT's private cloud databases and will be periodically made available with a [Creative Commons (CC) license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) in [Col·lectivaT's Hugging Face repository.](https://huggingface.co/datasets/collectivat/amazic) This means that anyone can see the translations you make and use them as they like.   
You must refrain from including any personally identifiable information in the sentences you submit.
The source sentences you translate from can either be your own creation or taken from non-copyrighted sources.
Your translations must also be your own creation, ensuring accuracy and respect while avoiding offensive or inappropriate content.
Project partners may conduct manual inspections of the contributions made by users. Failure to comply with any of these terms may result in the purging of your account and the removal of your contributions.

## Random Sentences

By using our “Random sentence” loading feature, you can access thousands of openly licensed sentences in all languages to translate. You can load as many times as you want and decide for yourself which one you want to translate.  
Most of these sentences are community-uploaded sentences from the [ Tatoeba platform. ](https://tatoeba.org/en/) If you come across any sentence that you think is offensive, racist, sexist, discriminatory, hateful, or otherwise violates our community guidelines, you can use the 'Report' button, and we will promptly investigate the issue and, if necessary, take appropriate action, including the removal of the offending content from our database.

## Machine Translation
Awal Translate enables automatic translation between Tamazight and four languages. This feature is powered by [Meta's NLLB model](https://ai.meta.com/blog/nllb-200-high-quality-machine-translation/),  an open-source model published for research purposes. However, the quality of Tamazight translations is currently quite low due to limited resources. One of the project's objectives is to enhance this model using the high-quality data we collect.
When making contributions, you have the option to use the machine translation feature to generate the translation to work with. However, it's crucial to edit this sentence appropriately to ensure accuracy. Machine-translated sentences without any edits are not accepted. Misuse of the machine translation feature may lead to the removal of your contributed phrases or even the suspension of your user account.
## Translation validation

Awal also allows community validation of translated phrases. This is to ensure accuracy of the sentences we collect which is essential in obtaining accurate models. You can accept good translations and reject the ones with containing major errors, misspellings and mistranslations. Minor errors and variant differences shouldn't be counted as errors.

## User Profile
You can fill in information like name, surname, age, sex, and language proficiency on the profile page. Your name, surname and e-mail address will not be disclosed publicly in any way.  
Demographic information like age, sex, and linguistic proficiency allows us to gain knowledge about our contributors' profile and assess the bias, quality, and quantity of the data we collect. By providing this information, you give permission to publish your translations together with this information.  
Your username is public and may be listed on the public leaderboards along with the contribution points you've gained. It is up to you to choose a username you like. Your username may be included in the published datasets alongside the translations you've submitted.
## Scoring
Contributors earn points for each translation they make. The points you gain are proportional to the length of the source phrase you input (when not using the “Random Sentence” feature) and the corresponding translation. If you utilize the machine translation feature, your target score will be calculated based on the number of changes you make.  
It's important to note that scoring is designed solely for friendly competition and does not imply any form of compensation.
