## About Awal
Awal is a project that contributes to preserving and promoting the Amazigh language in the digital space by developing innovative tools that facilitate its use and dissemination.<br/>
The participation of Amazigh speakers will be essential to collect data, both oral and written, through voice recordings and the collection of translated texts from this minority language. The initiative aims not only to create effective digital tools but also to raise community awareness of the importance of linguistic data and new technologies to preserve the language, to raise awareness of the effects of the digital divide, and to grow a network of professionals.<br/>
Awal is an initiative by CIEMEN, ColÂ·lectivaT, and Casa Amaziga de Catalunya and is funded by the Municipality of Barcelona and Generalitat de Catalunya with the support of the Catalan Development Cooperation Agency and the Department of Social Rights.<br/>
